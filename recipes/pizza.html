    <h2>Crunchy, crispy, cheese-laden pizza!</h2>
    <p>Detroit-style pizza is often referred to as a deep-dish pizza, but I don't think that accurately captures the essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good pizza. It has the flavor elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza and the texture of a light and airy focaccia. If you use a properly shaped pan, the edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 (.25oz) package of dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons olive oil - divided</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (24oz) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8oz Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>4oz mild Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8oz) package thick pepperoni slices</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start the dough: Pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Stir in yeast and sugar and let dissolve. Add bread flour, 2 teaspoons oil, and salt; knead until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic.</li>
            <li>Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan; use your fingers to spread oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then pull and stretch dough into a rectangular shape. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare the toppings: Dice Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into small cubes. Combine in a bowl and toss to mix. Set out pepperoni slices.</li>
            <li>Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing it into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch dough up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.</li>
            <li>Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese cubes evenly over top, making sure to fully cover all the edges where dough meets the pan. Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into 9 rectangular pieces.</li>
