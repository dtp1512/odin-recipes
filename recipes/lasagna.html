    <p>The recipe is customizable per your unique tastes, but we will provide the ingredients and steps for the original recipe down below</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Choice of meat: we recommend italian sausage and ground beef</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of garlic</li>
        <li> 1 Can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Cans of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 Cans of tomato pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>Spices: parsley, basil leaves, salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds, black pepper</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese: parmesan, mozzarella, ricotta</li>
        <li>Egg: helps to bind the ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
